# Welcome

Here I collect notes, code and other useful materials related to
deep learning and associated topics. Much of the introductory material is based on the
latter sections of _Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras
& TensorFlow_ ([Geron, A. \[2019\]](/sections/references/#Geron_A)). Other references
are introduced throughout the sections, and listed on
the [references](/sections/references) page.
